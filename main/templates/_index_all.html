        <p>The purpose of Open Source Fiction (OFiction in short) is to pool together the creativity and diversity of people around the world to build unique stories. Maybe you have an idea for a unique plot twist but no idea of how you can incorporate it into a storyline. Or maybe you have a great first chapter to a book but simply do not have time to write the rest. Or maybe you want to share a different ending of a famous classic. OFiction is a place in which users can put forward these fragmented ideas, develop on other's ideas, and ultimately come to create a work of fiction that no one could have accomplished on their own.</p>
